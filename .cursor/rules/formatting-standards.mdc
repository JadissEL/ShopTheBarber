# Formatting and code standards

- **Indentation and quotes**: 2 spaces; single quotes.
- **Naming**: Directories lowercase-with-dashes (e.g. `auth-wizard`). Components and interfaces PascalCase.
- **TypeScript**: Prefer `strict: true`; explicitly type function returns and object literals where it helps. Minimize `@ts-ignore`.
- **Complexity**: Prefer modular functions. Aim for O(n) or O(1); flag code that clearly exceeds these benchmarks.
