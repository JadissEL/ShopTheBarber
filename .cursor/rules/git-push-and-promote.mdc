# Git: Push for testing, then promote to main (MANDATORY)

Whenever we perform a change on the project:

1. **Push the new code for testing**  
   Commit and push to **`master`** (never push directly to `main`). CI runs on `master`.

2. **After CI passes on `master`**  
   Promote from `master` to **`main`** (via "Promote to main" workflow, or locally: checkout main → merge origin/master → push main → checkout master).

3. **Do not push to `main`** until tests/CI on `master` have passed.

Summary: **Change → push to master → wait for green CI → promote to main.**
