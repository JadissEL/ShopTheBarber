description: This project is a desktop-first web platform (SaaS/marketplace/dashboard). Desktop (≥1024px) is the primary experience; mobile and tablet are adaptations. Never treat it as a mobile app stretched to desktop. All layouts, components, and features must respect this.

# Desktop-first web platform (non-negotiable)

This is a **WEB PLATFORM FIRST**, not a mobile app that runs on desktop.

- **Primary experience**: Desktop (PC / laptop, ≥ 1024px).
- **Adaptations**: Mobile and tablet are responsive adaptations of the desktop experience.
- **Goal**: On PC it must feel like a full web platform (Shopify, Stripe, Linear, Notion style), **not** like a mobile app stretched to desktop.

## Core principle

- **Desktop is the primary experience.** Mobile and tablet are adaptations, not the base design.
- When used on a PC (≥ 1024px): it must feel like a real web platform and must **not** feel like a mobile app stretched to desktop.
- All current and future features, pages, components, and layouts must respect this.

## Desktop behavior (mandatory)

**On desktop (≥ 1024px):**

- Use wide layouts and available horizontal space.
- Use multi-column grids where appropriate.
- Use sidebar navigation or full top navigation (never bottom tab nav on desktop).
- Design for information-dense UI suitable for mouse and keyboard.
- Aim for platform-style UX (dashboards, tables, sidebars, top navs).

**Not allowed on desktop:**

- Bottom tab navigation.
- Floating “+” mobile-style action buttons as the primary CTA.
- Single-column-only layouts when content could use multiple columns.
- Touch-first spacing everywhere (excessive padding, oversized tap targets).
- Artificial max-width constraints that lock the layout to mobile width.

## Responsive definition

- **Responsive** means the **structure** changes at breakpoints, not just font size or padding.
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile each get intentionally designed layouts.
- Breakpoints to use:
  - **Mobile**: &lt; 768px
  - **Tablet**: 768px – 1023px
  - **Desktop**: ≥ 1024px
  - **Large desktop**: ≥ 1440px
- Desktop layouts must continue to scale and improve past 1024px (e.g. max-w-7xl, multi-column), not freeze at a narrow width.

## Development order

For every new task:

1. **Start with desktop layout first.**
2. Then adapt for tablet.
3. Then adapt for mobile.

If a component or pattern is mobile-specific (e.g. bottom nav, FAB):

- It must be **conditionally rendered** (e.g. hidden on desktop via `lg:hidden` or `useIsDesktop()`).
- It must **not** appear on desktop.

## Self-check before completing any task

- “Does this feel like a real web platform on PC?”
- “Would a SaaS user be comfortable using this all day on desktop?”
- “Is this optimized for mouse, keyboard, and large screens?”

If the answer is no → revise.

## Reference

- Layout and breakpoints: `docs/RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT.md`.
- Client zone: sidebar on desktop (`ClientDesktopSidebar`), bottom nav only on mobile (`ClientBottomNav` hidden when `useIsDesktop()`).
- Hook: `useIsDesktop()` from `@/hooks/useMediaQuery` for conditional desktop-only or mobile-only UI.
