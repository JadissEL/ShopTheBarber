# 💈 ShopTheBarber - Premium Barbershop Booking Platform

**Status**: ✅ Production-Ready | **Architecture**: 100% Sovereign | **Base44**: Fully Eradicated

A modern, elegant booking platform for barbershops and grooming professionals built with React, Fastify, and SQLite.

**UX**: Desktop-first web platform (SaaS/marketplace/dashboard). Desktop (≥1024px) is the primary experience; mobile and tablet are responsive adaptations. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE_DESKTOP_FIRST.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DESKTOP_FIRST.md) and [docs/RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT.md](docs/RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT.md).

**Features**: Full-stack, unified development only. Every feature must include frontend, UX, backend, database, and system uniformity—no isolated layers. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE_FULL_STACK_UNIFIED.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_FULL_STACK_UNIFIED.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd shop-the-barber

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

### Running Locally

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server**:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
```bash
npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment variables (no secrets in repo)

**Do not commit `.env`** — it may contain secrets. Use env vars for all sensitive config.

- **Backend**: Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and set:
  - `JWT_SECRET` — required; use a long random string in production
  - `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — for payments
  - `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` — for transactional email
  - `FRONTEND_URL` — for redirects and links in emails (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` in dev)
- See **server/.env.example** for the full list and comments.
- In production, set every required variable; do not rely on fallback defaults for secrets.
- **Stripe**: [docs/STRIPE_SETUP.md](docs/STRIPE_SETUP.md) — API key, webhook URL, events; **Quick fix** at top for "Stripe is not configured" (set `STRIPE_API_KEY` in `server/.env`, restart server). [docs/STRIPE_MCP_SETUP.md](docs/STRIPE_MCP_SETUP.md) — set keys via MCP or `server/.stripe-keys.json`.
- **Resend**: [docs/RESEND_SETUP.md](docs/RESEND_SETUP.md) — API key, domain verification, sender address.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Core entities (16 tables total):
- `users` - User accounts & authentication
- `barbers` - Professional profiles
- `shops` - Barbershop configurations
- `bookings` - Appointment records
- `services` - Service catalog
- `shifts` - Operating hours
- `time_blocks` - Vacations, breaks
- `loyalty_profiles` - Customer rewards
- `loyalty_transactions` - Points history
- `messages` - Client-provider chat
- `notifications` - System alerts
- `disputes` - Payment disputes
- `audit_logs` - Compliance tracking
- Plus: shop_members, pricing_rules, reviews, payouts, etc.

**Database is engine-agnostic**: Easy migration from SQLite → PostgreSQL when needed.

---

## 🚀 Deployment (always running)

To have the app **always running** and **auto-deploy on push**: deploy the frontend to **Vercel** and the backend to **Render**, with the repo on **GitHub**. Step-by-step: **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**. To do it **via MCP** (AI creates and manages services from Cursor): **[docs/DEPLOYMENT_MCP.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_MCP.md)**.

- **Frontend (Vercel)**: Connect the repo, set `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL, deploy. Each push to `main` redeploys.
- **Backend (Render)**: New Web Service, root `server`, start `npm run start`, set `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, Stripe keys. Optional: use the repo’s `render.yaml` Blueprint.
- **Database**: Default is SQLite (on Render free tier the disk is ephemeral). For persistent data, add a hosted DB later (e.g. Render Postgres).
- **Environment**: On the server machine, copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and set **JWT_SECRET**, **STRIPE_***, **RESEND_***, **FRONTEND_URL** (and optionally **DATABASE_PATH**). Never commit `.env`.
- **Database**: Default is SQLite (`sovereign.sqlite` in `server/`). For production you can keep SQLite or migrate to PostgreSQL; run migrations with `npm run push` (or your migration command) after setting DB URL/path.
- **CORS**: Backend has CORS enabled; set the frontend origin in production so only your app can call the API.

---

## 🔧 Development

- **Architecture & schema**: See **PROJECT_SCHEMA.md** for high-level architecture and **PROJECT_TRACKER.md** for DB schema status, completed actions, and roadmap.
- **Running locally**: Backend on port 3001, frontend on 3000; frontend proxies `/api` to the backend (see Quick Start). **Seed the database** so Find a Barber, bookings, and Marketplace have data: in `server/` run `npm run push` (if needed) then `npm run seed`. For Marketplace products, run `npm run create-products-table` if migrations don’t create the products table. See [docs/BOOKING_FLOWS.md](docs/BOOKING_FLOWS.md) for barber-first vs service-first booking flows and data requirements.

### Frontend
```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
```

### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm run dev          # Start dev server (watch mode)
npm run generate     # Generate Drizzle migrations
npm run push         # Push schema to database
npm run seed         # Seed database with sample data
npm run studio       # Open Drizzle Studio (DB GUI)
npm run test         # Run server tests (Vitest)
```
